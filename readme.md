### Motivation

I stood this integration up for a community organizer and thought I would strip it down and share it.

### Installation

Copy and Paste easy.

:hand: PREREQUISITE: You must have your organizer ID and oAuth anonymous key from Eventbrite.  These arguments are required to call the API.

The easiest way to install this example is to copy and paste it, or clone it.
